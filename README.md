# SudokuProj

## Context of this project

- This is a project I made during my eleventh grade year for school demonstrating my ability to interpret and traverse more complex data structures such as 2d arrays.

## What does it do
- Sudoku.java Class:

    - Can check if the sudoku board is filled out properly

    - Given the sudoku board intiialized in a 9x9 array list representing the filled in data within a board, the program will be able to determine the "tic marks" or the possible values that can go into the the blank or null items within the array

    - Contains most of the functionality required by the main to run


- MyProgram Class:

    - The main program which initializes the boards to your needs and can be adjusted in the text editor.

    - Gives an example as to creating a completely random board

    - Is the implementation of the sudoku class and cell object.

- Cell Class:

    - Used to make an array list of cell objects with easy access and functionality.

## How?

- isValid()
    - Works by traversing in in 3 different ways:
